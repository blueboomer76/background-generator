# Pattern Generator
A pattern generator for creating backgrounds for HTML pages, made with JavaScript. Many different patterns and gradients are possible, and random ones can be generated along with the text colors.

Include the `patternGenerator.js` file directly in your projects, then add some code like the following to your HTML:

```html
<script src="patternGenerator.js"></script>
<script>patternGenerator.applyRandomPattern();</script>
```
